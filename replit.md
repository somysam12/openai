## October 19, 2025 - Comprehensive Admin Features: Chat Management & Live Group Sessions

**Feature**: Major admin panel expansion with chat management and live group messaging capabilities.

**Implementation**:

### 1. View User Chats by Username
- Admin can retrieve complete DM history of any user by entering their username
- Shows last 20 messages with timestamps
- Includes both user messages and bot responses

### 2. Delete Chat History
- **Delete User Chats**: Remove all DM history for a specific username
- **Delete ALL Chats**: Clear entire chat database with confirmation
- Both options include user confirmation dialogs for safety

### 3. Live Group Messaging Sessions
- Admin can view list of all groups the bot is in
- Select any group to start a live messaging session
- During active session:
  - All group messages forwarded to admin in real-time
  - Admin messages sent through bot to the group
  - Acts as a bridge for admin to participate in group conversations
- Clean session termination with "End Session" button

### 4. Enhanced Database Schema
- Added `group_registry` table to track all groups
- Extended `chat_history` with `message_role`, `chat_type`, `chat_id` columns for complete transcripts
- Composite indexes on (user_id, timestamp) and (username, timestamp) for fast queries

- Session cleanup on "End Session" for both user and group sessions

**Technical Details**:
- Group tracking happens automatically when messages arrive
- Bi-directional message routing during live sessions
- Privacy requirement: Bot must have Privacy Mode OFF in groups to monitor all messages

**Previous Enhancement** - Enhanced Keyword System with Knowledge Base Integration:
- Keywords can now intelligently use the Knowledge Base for responses
- When adding a keyword without a custom response (e.g., just `price`), the bot uses AI + Knowledge Base to generate intelligent context-aware responses
- When adding a keyword with a custom response (e.g., `price | ‚Çπ500`), the bot sends that exact response

# System Architecture

## Dual Architecture Approach

**Problem**: Supporting both traditional deployment and modern agent-based workflows with different infrastructure requirements.

**Solution**: Implemented two parallel architectures:
1. Python-based standalone bot (main.py) for simple deployments
2. TypeScript/Mastra framework for advanced features and workflow orchestration

**Rationale**: Provides flexibility for different deployment scenarios while maintaining core functionality.

## Python Implementation (Primary)

### Application Framework
- **Technology**: Python 3 with `python-telegram-bot` library (v21.0.1)
- **Entry Point**: `main.py` serves as the main bot application
- **Pattern**: Event-driven command and message handlers

### Conversation Storage
- **Database**: SQLite3 with local file storage (`chat_history.db`)
- **Schema**: Stores user messages, bot responses, timestamps, and user metadata
- **Approach**: Simple relational storage for conversation history without external dependencies
- **Trade-offs**: SQLite provides simplicity and portability but limited scalability for high-concurrency scenarios

### AI Integration
- **Provider**: OpenAI API (configurable base URL support)
- **Model**: Defaults to GPT-4 or compatible models
- **Context Management**: Retrieves last 10 messages per user for conversation continuity
- **Prompt Engineering**: Personality-driven instructions for multilingual, friendly interactions

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Admin System**: Environment variable-based admin ID for privileged operations
- **User Blocking**: Database-tracked blocked users with admin-only management
- **Mechanism**: Simple ID-based checks without complex role systems

## TypeScript/Mastra Implementation (Advanced)

### Framework Architecture
- **Core**: Mastra framework (@mastra/core v0.20.0) for agent orchestration
- **Workflow Engine**: Inngest for event-driven workflow execution
- **Pattern**: Agent-based architecture with step-based workflows

### Agent Configuration
- **Agent**: `telegramChatAgent` with dynamic instructions
- **Memory**: PostgreSQL-based conversation memory via `@mastra/memory`
- **Model**: OpenAI GPT-4 with configurable endpoints
- **Features**: Multi-step reasoning (maxSteps: 5) for complex interactions

### Workflow System
- **Pattern**: Step-based workflows using Inngest
- **Key Workflow**: `telegramChatWorkflow` - processes messages through agent and sends responses
- **Steps**: 
  1. `use-agent`: Generate AI response with conversation context
  2. `send-telegram-reply`: Deliver response back to user
- **Error Handling**: Configurable retry logic (3 attempts in production, 0 in development)

### Storage Architecture
- **Primary Storage**: PostgreSQL via `@mastra/pg`
- **Alternative**: LibSQL support via `@mastra/libsql`
- **Connection**: Shared connection pool pattern (`sharedPostgresStorage`)
- **Configuration**: Environment-based connection strings with localhost fallback

### Web Interface
- **Frontend**: Static HTML/CSS/JS served from `/public`
- **Style**: Gradient-based modern UI with chat bubbles
- **Session Management**: Client-generated session IDs for web users
- **API**: RESTful endpoints for message handling

### Trigger System
- **Telegram Integration**: Webhook-based message handling via `/webhooks/telegram/action`
- **Event Routing**: Inngest function wrapping for API routes
- **Pattern**: Decoupled trigger registration for extensibility

## Development Features

### TypeScript Configuration
- **Target**: ES2022 with ES module system
- **Module Resolution**: Bundler mode for modern tooling

- **ADMIN_ID**: Administrative user identification
- **DATABASE_URL**: PostgreSQL connection (TypeScript version)
- **OPENAI_BASE_URL**: Custom API endpoint (optional)
- **NODE_ENV**: Environment detection (production/development)

## Extensibility Design

### Tool System (Mastra)
- **Pattern**: `createTool()` for reusable functions
- **Schema**: Zod-based input/output validation
- **Example**: `exampleTool` demonstrates tool creation pattern
- **Integration**: Tools can be attached to agents

### Agent Extensibility
- **Instructions**: Async function support for dynamic behavior
- **Model Selection**: Runtime-configurable model choice
- **Tools**: Dynamic tool attachment per agent
- **Memory**: Pluggable memory backends
